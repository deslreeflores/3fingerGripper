# 3 FINGER GRIPPER
This project demonstrates two methods for controlling a 3-finger dextrous gripper using an Arduino Uno and a 360Â° positional servo:

1. **ROS 2 Serial Control (RS485)**:
An earlier version of the project enabled **ROS 2** control over **RS485 serial communication**. A custom ROS 2 Python node published open and close commands to the Arduino, allowing integration with larger robotic systems and automation frameworks.

2. **IR Remote Control**:
The final design uses an **infrared** remote to open and close the gripper directly. The Arduino decodes the IR signals and drives the servo to open or close the gripper. This approach provides a simple, standalone solution without requiring a PC or ROS environment.

Both control methods are documented to showcase the flexibility of the system and the development process from PC-based to fully embedded control.

The steps for the method using ROS 2 Serial Control will be presented first with hardware, firmware, and software, then followed by the IR Remote Control approach.

# ROS 2 SERIAL CONTROL GRIPPER (RS485)
---
This project enables ROS2 control of a 3-finger adaptive gripper using an Arduino microcontroller and RS485 serial communication. The goal is to design, build, and test working system to receive open and close commands from a ROS 2 node, parsing them on the Arduino, and driving a servo motor accordingly.
# Overview
The system bridges a gap in robotics research by providing a gripper that:
- Uses standardized communication (RS485),
- Integrates cleanly with ROS 2-based workflows,
- And is built from affordable, off-the-shelf components.
  
## Hardware Components: 
- Arduino Uno
- MAX485 Module
- USB-to-RS485 Adapter
- FT6335M Servo Motor 
- 5V 2A Power Supply w/ Barrel Jack

### 2. Arduino Firmware
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Connect to Arduino Uno in 'COM4' port
3. Flash sketch to Arduino Uno

# ROS2 SOFTWARE
### Requirements: 
1. ROS2 (Humble recommended)
   **If using a virtual machine, ensure devices (Arduino Uno and USB-to-RS485 Adapter) are successfully recognized and given full permissions using
 ```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
 ```
   or
```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
```


2. Python3.8+
### ROS2 Dependencies: 
- `rclpy`
- `std_msgs`
- `colcon` build system
- `rosdep` (dependency manager)
### Python Dependencies:
- `pyserial`
  ```bash
  pip install pyserial

# STEP 1: Create ROS2 Workspace
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws

colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```
# STEP 2: Create package inside ros2_ws/src
```bash
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python gripper_commander
```
# STEP 4: Inside gripper_commander add serial_node.py
```bash
code .
```
This will open Visual Studios where you can navigate packages and python scripts. Add serial_node.py 
# STEP 5: Build Package inside ros2_ws
```bash
colcon build --packages-select gripper_commander
```
# STEP 6: Run Node
```bash
ros2 run gripper_commander serial_node
```
In second terminal run open and close commands:
```bash
ros2 topic pub /gripper_command std_msgs/String "data: 'open'"

ros2 topic pub /gripper_command std_msgs/String "data: 'close'"
```
# IR REMOTE-CONTROLLED GRIPPER
This section will explain how to control the gripper using an IR sensor with a paired IR Remote. Because of early challenges with integrating a pressure sensor, the remote was added as an alternative method to control the dexterity of the gripper
### Hardware Components: 
- Arduino Uno
- IR Reciever Module
- IR Remote
- FT6335M Servo Motor
- 5V 2A Power Supply w/ Barrel Jack (used as an External Power Source)
